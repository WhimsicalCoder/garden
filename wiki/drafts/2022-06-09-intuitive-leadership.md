An ethnography of senior leaders might uncover a specific gap between "accepted wisdom" and "how things really work".

That is, that 


You look around and:

- the mission & vision is only half-formed (it was the output of the strategic leadership offsite but still isn't locked yet)
- your data is not complete, you can only see some of what you want and don't fully trust the other half. Rebuilding your data pipeline and measurement is in the plan for the later part of the year
- You have a product roadmap and set of priorities but what's on paper only partially matches the actual resources available (one product team is down two people and they've been trying to hire into those roles for months and another has a weak PM that isn't pulling their weight)

Intuitive strategy and intuitive leadershp iis **how you survive**. It's how you keep moving forward, operating in uncertainty and dealing with resource constraints.

But intuitive leadership is exhausting. And it's also not super effective.

It's a kind of half-formed starting point that is a combination of

Experiences
Skills
Intuition

But the problem is

Previous experiene is only partially transferable
Your existing skillset is only partly valuable
Your intuition is only directionally correct

So you need to strengthen your point of view and your "strategic leadership". How do you turn your intuition into something more concrete, credible and clear?
