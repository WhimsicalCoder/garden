Innovation projects tend to focus on creating shiny artifacts. But maybe they should focus on the components, archives and iterations of their work instead?

The first innovation project I worked on at Google Creative Lab was a 5-year vision for "The future of search". No big deal. We ended up creating the shiniest of shiny artifacts - a 15 minute live action video showing a day in the life of this future search world. We filmed some segments at the Museum of Natural History in New York. I almost broke a dinosaur bone carrying a lighting stand.

The Google Creative Lab knows a thing or two about failed innovation. 





I know a bit about failed innovation. I worked with the Google Creative Lab back in 2012-2014 and it seemed like 90% of the innovation projects "failed" in many classical definitions.

I can't speak to how the Creative Lab is now but back in 2012 it was very disconnected from the rest of Google. Sat in an ivory tower (quite literally) this distance and separation was, I think, part of what enabled the team to work on weird and wonderful projects without oversight. But it was also the downfall of many of the projects that tried to bridge the gap and inform the main corporate strategy of big-G Google proper.

From new kinds of shopping ads to a vision to the future of search - things that tried to influence the core direction of Google products inevitably "failed".

I put quotes around the word "failed" though because innovation is a funny kind of work.

I worked on an NYT R&D project - all about launching a brand new approach to travel content. We pitched the project in Feb 2020. Not a great time for a travel project in hindsight...

Like I said, I know a bit about failed innovation.

But innovation is a funny kind of work.

Managing innovation work is about controlling narrative as much as it's about controlling cost/timing/project management.

We had a custom-built solution at the Creative Lab called OTIS. It basically stripped away any kind of

I've been reading [The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process](https://www.amazon.com/Informational-City-Economic-Restructuring-Development/dp/0631179372) in which Manuel explores the idea of a "space of flows":

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Space%20of%20flows%20-%20Wikipedia" data-author="" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows">
The <b>space of flows</b> is a high-level cultural abstraction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" title="Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" title="Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>, and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells" title="Manuel Castells" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel Castells</a> to "reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm"

I think this phrase is a great concept for innovation work - it's not the work itself. It's about the space of flows.s

It feels almost quaint to observe that everything is moving to streams and feeds. That's been happening for some time now. We've moved from a Koolhaas theory of Junk-space to a Castells theory of Junk-feeds.

And professional work is no different. We're almost a decade into the stream-ification of work. Slack heralded an era of realtime notifications, channels (as virtual spaces to work in).

Streaming content on the consumer side though is looking very differnet. Algorithmic feeds and livestreams.





Slack changed the view of work from document to stream. THe flow of information.

What would an innovation version of this look like?

People who work in innovation labs tend to be highly disillusioned. I was joking with someone the other day about the "innovation trauma" scene. Trauma of course is no laughing matter, but the idea
