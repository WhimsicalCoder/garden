This is a post celebrating my 6 year indie-versary. ðŸ¥³

On October 24th 2014 I stepped out into the unknown wilds of independent work and each year I write a recap of the year behind. This year's post is late because I was not metaphorically on the road but *literally* on the road - we've been spending 2020 on an extended road trip across the US as a way to make the most of the pandemic situation.

I've written before about how being independent feels like being on the road so it's a nice metaphor that we're spending the year actually on the road...

I feel incredibly grateful, humbled and privileged to be able to take off onto the road with my family - to be able to still have work, let alone be able to work from the road. In the mess of 2020 I feel very lucky.

I'll get to some themes and ideas for the year ahead, but first some reflections on 2020:

## The Quarantined Independent

## Independence vs Interdependence

## Writing - The Book & the Blog

## Little Futures

## Wealth vs Revenue

So what's in store for the year ahead?
