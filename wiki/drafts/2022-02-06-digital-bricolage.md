I recently tried to map out the various lines of inquiry - to connect the dots across a range of disparate projects and interests. One theme that clearly emerged from that introspection was the importance of **digital bricolage**.

Digital what?

Bricolage:


When I look back at my work with the web I've *always* been remixing, hacking and tinkering with the web. Trying to ask questions like what does the web feel like? How do you treat the web as a texture? What can you do with the web?

But formal coding - and running my own servers and infrastructure - has never interested me. I've always been more interested in a light touch experience. The web as light as gossamer.

So, digital bricolage.

Here's a few of the various projects that I've worked on
