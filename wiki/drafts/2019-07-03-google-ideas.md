I'm kind of obsessed with how to get buy-in for your ideas.

- Exhibit A: My [book on independent consulting](https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/)
- Exhibit B: My [SEO MBA online course in executive communication](https://seomba.com/executive-presence/)

I worked at Google sometime 2012-2014 and I thought it would be fun to dust off some of my old ideas and figure out why they never went anywhere.

This is one part nostalgia, and one part recording the ideas on my blog (now that enough time has passed hopefully that Google lawyers don't come after me). Maybe we can learn something about how to pitch ideas, how to get buy-in and examine corporate frustration and autonomy (or lack thereof).

All of these were ideated and pitched internally sometime 2012-2014 while I was working at Google Creative Lab or as part of the Google Jamboard team.

## Idea 1 - Google Workspace

### *Collaborate on projects, not just docs*

**The idea**: A workspace for Google teams, combining Google+ streams, Gmail and Drive into one unified experience. Somewhere between Basecamp and Slack. This was *just* before Slack launched (Slack launched in 2013) and frankly I think it was a bit ahead of it's time.

This was *obviously* a good idea - for teams "all in" on Google Docs / Drive / Gmail / Hangouts it's always been frustrating keeping things organized and collaborating on projects[^collab]

[^collab]: It's remarkable how Google is spectacularly good at collaboration on documents and spectacularly bad at collaboration on projects.

I think it was so *obviously* a good idea. Google has since launched Google WorkSpaces that achieve some of the same goals but frankly 

There were some nice touches I remember. For example: every project would have it's own email alias - which would be a full gmail account that any member can send/receive from. Creating a kind of transparent-by-default email address. Not only useful for transparency within the team, but also useful for collaborating with external teams / partners. I guess this is like an over-engineered version of shared slack channels ha! Overall I think this was a clunky - not chat focused enough version of Slack, with Google docs / drive embedded at it's core.

**How I pitched it**: hallway conversations with execs (I recall one SVP pulling me aside and telling me to work on this instead of everything else, but.. not to tell anyone).

**Why it failed**: Well, aside from the loooooong history of Google fumbling the ball with real-time chat products.... I think there's two reasons it failed. Firstly I was pitching it inside the Google Creative Lab and the lab hated working on anything that wasn't consumer facing (this was mostly before the consumerization of the B2B landscape - remember Slack kind of pioneered that movement).

Secondly, I wish I'd had a working prototype - I pitched it by mocking up the UI instead of mocking up the work-flow. I think showing a sample project in-flow would have been more powerful than presenting static mocks of UI that frankly were hard to understand (I'm not a designer!)

If you look at Google Workspaces - it's actually a fairly faithful execution of what I had envisaged. But it's clunky and doesn't put **chat channels** as primary. In hindsight, if I'd pitched this with a stronger focus on mobile, real-time chat and lightweight ephemeral channels vs big heavy *projects* I think it could have gained a bit more steam.

## Idea 2 - Google Maps Search 2.0

### *Use maps to search, not just directions*

**The idea**: let you search for "things" on Google maps, not just places. Still today in 2019 when you search on Google Maps for something like "HDMI cable" or "Lamb Tagine" or "Comedy night" you get businesses and places as results - not the objects, events or information you were looking for. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy because if those searches don't work then people don't search for them and so on.

You could argue that Google Maps isn't really designed to be used that way? But I think that's a stupid argument - I bet a TON of people search like that and expect Google to just figure it out - AND my argument is that IF you encouraged people to search this way you'd open up a TON more commercial search intent inside Google Maps - thus driving more Google Maps ad spend.

**How I pitched it**: I pitched it in two ways. Firstly by building an actual MVP. I'm still surprised I pulled this off but I built a working prototype in Google Sheets using scripts to basically first run a Google Maps search, then find all the websites for the listings and then search each of the websites for the keyword used and then filter the results. It actually worked pretty well which I was amazed by and the underlying technology was simple - just combining the Google Maps places info with the Google Search crawl info of what was available. The second way I pitched it was by a very rough market sizing of the ad opportunity on Google Maps and how that would be dramatically expanded if we could shift consumer behaviour from searching for places (where relevance for ads is low) to searching for things (where relevance for ads is high).

**Why it failed**: I actually thing this entirely failed because of the Google Sheets prototype. It was a functional working data model but had zero GUI and when Andy Berndt looked at it he completely shut it down.

In hingsight I think I'd have pitched it with two clear, distinct arguments:

1. Data. With a little research 
2. Launch campaign. Part of the magic here is that if you'd unveiled a "new kind of maps search" I think it would have done very well.

Apple Maps had just launched 

I actually wish I'd pitched this more strongly *outside* the Creative Lab. WIth a little research on number of searches and Google Maps ad revenue I think you could have made a strong 

## Idea 3 - Google Illustrator

### *A Google design tool with real time collaboration in your browser*

A vector based canvas model. This was before the collaborative design tools like invision, figma etc.

Figma wouldn't launch for another 4 years and 

How I pitched it: using a blog post! I built a

I got some fairly senior folks excited about the idea but when I spoke with some PMs it kind of withered. They pointed out that Google Slides isn't a vector canvas and this would be a complete rebuild. I didn't have a design background and I think that if I could have bought one of the senior design leaders at Google along to champion this could have gained some steam.

In hindsight the pitch goes something like:

1. This is a big market and opportunity (how big is Adobe? collaborative design is clearly the next thing, do for design in the browser what Gmail did for email in the browser!)
2. Imagine how much a *design* tool inside Google Docs suite would have improved the image and reputation for Google Docs? 

## Idea 4 - Google Cube

### *A physical assistant that can project light and scan docs*

Ok ok, this one might not have been the most practical based on Lamps http://berglondon.com/blog/2012/12/19/lamps/ it was a little cute cube that would sit on your kitchen / living counter in your home and would do two things. Scan paperwork that you put next to it and also project information onto a surface. Basically a short throw projector combined with camera.

The core utility of auto-scanning paperwork to Google Drive actually got some people excited but in hindsight I was *so close* to the idea of alexa/google home but I just barely missed the idea of voice+screen in your kitchen. I think if I'd pushed this a little harder I could have built some prototypes but the team I was on at the time was focused on building what would become Google Jamboard and they didn't have the bandwidth for it.

In hindsight I think if I'd just asked for budget and a team to build a prototype I might have gotten it. Maybe my biggest regret for this one is not filing a patent. I think the short throw projects / document scanning might have been novel. 

⏱️⏱️⏱️

Anyway. I'm still wistful for what could have been. I think all these ideas had some kind of viable kernel in them. It's easy to look back with the virtue of hindsight, but it's interesting to me to note the timing:

1. Google Workspace, pitched right before Slack appeared (pitched 2012, Slack launched 2013)
2. Maps Search, right as Apple Maps launched and flopped (pitched early 2012, Apple Maps launched Sep 2012)
3. Google Illustrator, pitched a few years before Figma appeared (pitched 2014, Figma launched 2016)
4. Google Cube, pitched just before Alexa was launched (pitched early 2014, Alexa launched Nov 2014)

I'm not really sure what to make of all that. Maybe my timing was just terrible? Or maybe my timing was amazing, but my pitch was bad? Maybe these are just bad ideas? Or maybe (most likely) with a bit more maturity now I think I could have made a stronger pitch and at least pushed some of these ideas to prototype / concept stage...
