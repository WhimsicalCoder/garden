**So I can write code inside my spreadsheet, but not inside my browser? WTF.**

Ok, let's back up. Coding is too hard.

I've been playing with the web and code for years now and still feel like I'm an outsider to the "code club". An incomplete list of things I've tried and failed to do:

- Failed to install node
- Failed to install pip
- Failed to install ruby

Meanwhile, things I do regularly:

- Use Github extensively for a variety of projects all through the Github GUI
- Use Glitch to host some simple Node.js apps
- Maintain a fairly complex Jekyll blog hosted on Github pages without Ruby or Jekyll running locally

Increasingly there's a disconnect between the kinds of activities code enables and the "expected" workflow for "being a coder".

## Defaults Matter

Defaults allow people to get started. Python is installed by default on the mac and so I've found it very easy to do some lightweight Python coding (e.g. [some glitch art](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/11/07/privacy-glitch/))

*Can you imagine if Node.js was installed by default?*

## GUIs Matter

People hate command lines - not only do they LOOK scary, they give weird unhelpful error messages and... you have to type everything. Ugh. This is why people would rather code inside a spreadsheet application - because it's an application.

*Can you imagine if the beginner version of Node.js came pre-installed with a GUI for managing and running your code?*

## New Browsers

Ok let's back up. This post is just saw raw notes thinking about ways to make code more accessible to people, and thinking about the role the browser plays.

I can write code inside my spreadsheet but inside the browser? Yes Repl.it and Glitch and others are making really great progress in helping you code without installing anything and I love them but using a web IDE is still slow and still requires 

There's no universality to it.

What if the browser was a GUI, runtime and code editor all in one?
