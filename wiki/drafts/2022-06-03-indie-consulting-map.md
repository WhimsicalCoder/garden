I've got a few friends on the cusp of independent life, either just about to leap into the unknown or already quit they're and trying to figure it out.

So here's a half-baked thesis and possible blueprint for navigating indie life.

First, some core assumptions and insights:

## 1. Consulting is cash freedom

For that reason, and because it's what I know, consulting and client work features heavily here. You do you.

I wrote about that in my piece [Sparring & Tenure for Indie Consultants](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/05/28/sparring-and-tenure/). Not all kinds of work have the same headspace, stress and time commitment.

It can be a real failure mode to try and "start a startup" and "do some consulting" at the same time. Trying to balance these two competing types of work is extremely stressful and difficult.

Instead, view consulting work (i.e. freelance work) as a way to stabalize cash flow, build a cash warchest and leverage into higher order forms of consulting that are high $$ while low headspace (like sparring). Getting to a point where you can do client projects with high revenue and clear time boxed availability is the necessary freeedom you need to be able to also build a startup / write a book / build a project that might have real equity.

Consulting builds no equity, but it builds cash and calendar freedom to be able to build something that has equity.

## 2. Positioning is for the ego, not for the market
I've got a full post here, but in short - it's more important to find a way to be visible, with a vibe rather than craft a tight positioning ("I am an X for Y" or "I do XYZ for companies like ABC"). You think positioning is important but it's just for your own sense of self-narrative and identity. WHich by the way is important!

Paul Millered captured this as [don't find a niche, find a mode](https://think-boundless.com/dont-find-a-niche-find-a-mode/) and Venkatesh articulated as [find a streak not a niche](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1531762440412614656).

So, you have to find a niche, or a streak. It's easier and more valuable than crafting a tight positioning.

But - your identity and self-narrative is important! So you should *also* craft some narrative aircover. This is some kind of project, website, initiative that you can lean on during the early days of figuring out indie life. Before you have a stable, real sense of how you're making money or even WTF you're doing you want some narrative aircover. There's three key ingredients to narrative aircover:

1. It must be completely within your control. This isn't about success, it's just about effort. Not "I'm selling tons of art" but "I'm making an art website platform".
2. Preferably non revenue generating. So people can't measure it's success (or failure) easily.
3. It has to be interesting. Art, books, culture, community, non-profit. Make it something that makes you more interesting.

Then, while you're trying to figure out if you're an *"independent consultant"* or just *"unemployed"* you can talk to people about what you're up *"I'm building an art platform, and looking for consulting work"*

## 3. Change is continuous and self-directed, so you can stomach "bad" work because you can escape it faster

Because 

When I started out, I had dreams of "innovation work" but quickly landed SEO audit work and hated muyself. Until I realized that cashing in invoices was simply teh way to start teh engine. Within 9 months I was already leaving that work behind and evolving my offering, the seniority of myclients and more.

So do whatever it takes to cash those first few invoices. That work doesn't define you. Fire up the engine and power out of it into better / more interesting / more expensive work. It'll happen faster than you think.

## 4. How much "time" you have is linked to energy not time

There's a real link betweeen energy and time. Now that you're out on your own you need to build your own mix of projects, only some of which will be revenue generating. But feed your soul with the right balance and you'll be able to achieve so much more than narrowing your work too tightly. Importantly - don't judge your projects by "how cool they sound" or "how creative they seem" - focus specifically on what the work looks like day to day.

Ok, so with those assumptions out the way, here's the roadmap. It's a sketch and work in progress so I'm sure I'll figure out a better version but here we are for now.

Open the roadmap in figma

There's phases.

## Phase 1: Making the leap, zero to one

This phase typically starts just before you actually quit your job. Starting to think about going independent, trying to line up work for when you quit. This phase is defined by doing whatever it takes to send your first invoice without shattering your self-confidence and identity.

Above the surface: Do whatever it takes to get your first invoice paid
- Who can you email? Old clients, bosses, colleagues? Send a note letting them know you're looking for work.
- How can you let people know that you’re “in the market”?
- How can you assemble a portfolio or set of case studies?

Below the surface: Do whatever it takes to hold yourself together
- What is something you can do that's public and within your control as narrative aircover?
- Maybe start a practice of journaling or note taking as a way to examine your own identity and ego more directly?
- 

Potential failure modes:
- Trying to craft a tight positoning for your work. You'll fail because you don't have any work yet, don't know what you want to do or who you want to be. What you're really chasing is a coherent identity. Chase narrative aircover right now instead.
- Trying to do client work AND build a startup or Big Project. Have patience. Remember that freelancing and consulting isn't a treadmill, it's a path to cash and calendar freedom. Equity and building comes later. Pay an invoice first.
- Don't over-complicate your business setup. I didn't start an LLC till year 2 and I still make my invoices in Google Docs and track revenue in a spreadsheet. It's OK to be afraid of this stuff, it's not OK to be paralyzed by it. It's new and uncomfortable, but it's not hard. And it doesn't have to be complicated.

## Phase 2: Getting started

This phase is the real beginnings of freelance/independent living. You've got a few clients, done a little work, sent some invoices. Now you start to question whether this client work is any fun. Are you being useful? Doing good work? This phase is defined by deliberate learning and experimentation.

Above the surface:
- Care about your work product. Share them with friends. Ask clients for feedback. Think about ways to level up and get more senior in your work. What does the level above you look like? 
- Experiment with writing and "being visible" - whether blog posts or LinkedIn posts. You need to develop a voice and the only way to do that is through experimenting and hitting publish on things. Any things. Small things. Things with personality.
- How did your current clients find you? What commonality can you draw from this in terms of industry / job role / how they found you? How can you use that to find more people like them?
- Maybe think about starting a newsletter or a blog. But don't overthink it. It's not "The Ultimate Destination for Content Marketing Strategy" - it's just "Tom's blog" for now. Remove hte pressure and don't pick a niche. Just publish. One foot in front of the other.

Below the surface:
- How are you spending your time? Which parts of client work light you up? What do you want to do more/less of?
- Notice which things you say that gets the strongest reaction from clients. This is your early signal of where your voice is and where your opinions are interesting to the market.
- Find other people on the indie path (hi!) and chat with them. Build relationships, friendships and communities. Start one if you can't find one. This is essential psychological and identity work to make this path sustainable.

Potential failure modes:
- Trying to partner with others. You likely miss having colleagues and team mates. And you're likely slightly insecure about the quality of your work. THAT'S OK. Me too. You don't have to deal with that by building a goddam agency. Join (or start) a slack group. Find a few peers to chat with and chat with them. Meet people for coffee meetings. Share your work products with close friends and advisors. Starting an agency ruins your ability to use consulting revenue as the cash and calendar freedom you need later on.
- Crafting a positioning statement. Seriously. Streaks > niches. Anytime you *think* you want to craft a tight positioning statement, instead of putting it on your homepage as "I do X for Y" instead write a 2,000 word blogpost about "How I do X for Y". Don't be so arrogant to asusme that you have tons of leads and need positioning to filter your leads. Instead it's about demand generation - how do you get more people knowing about you. And whatever you do don't write that essay in businessspeak. Let your punk and vibe ooze out of the pores. It's about showing off how you think, not doing some generic SEO or content marketing bullshit.

## Phase 3: Find stability

This phase is where we start to really find our groove. If you're doing it well this is where you step on the gas in terms of revenue and figure out how to consistently find good clients.

Above the surface:
- Raise your seniority and raise your rates. Chase more senior work, more expensive work.
- Really think about what the venn diagram of work you enjoy and work that the market wants
- Create a consistent publishing habit. Twitter/LinkedIn/Email/Blog doesn't matter too much but you're *really* gonna regret not building this habit at this stage.
- Consider starting a community - now that you know a bit about yourself and the kind of work that you're doing focus on 

Below the surface:
- You can't sustain publishing without being interested in something. So deeply consider how to write and publish in a way that keeps you engaged. Don't write "for SEO" or some BS. Figure out what you're interested in and write about that.
- You're a real business now but that doesn't mean you have to act like one. Find language to describe your work in a way that doesn't make you want to vomit.
- You probably want an LLC and business apparatus at this point. Find a way to have "your corporate entity" send your invoices. Otherwise you're going to vomit when you send a $50k invoice (or worse, get anxious and panic and never send the invoice). You need some psychological armor for the arena of capitalism.

Potential failure modes:
- Don't try and operationalize your way out of the routine work. Don't hire people, don't outsource. Just elevate into the more senior strategy work. Charge more. Building a whole machine to do the execution work is just trapping yourself at this level and prevents you reaching level 4 & 5. Consider partnering with agencies or vendors to work on the execution but remain separate - don't bring on responsibilities or overhead. 
- Now that you're earning good money you can get stuck just doing the same thing over and over again. Force yourself to keep learning, keep moving. There are always more senior levels to reach. Look for them, get access to them.
- Now that you're generating leads for good money it's easy to simply burnout from overwork. You're forcing your rates higher and higher and it's getting harder and harder to say no to work (*"Can I turn down this $20k client gig to take a week off"*). Don't overwhelm yourself with hours worked - take breaks. Start an exercise routine (yours has probably evaporated in phases 1 and 2 I'm sorry to say.)
- Not being visible enough. You can be increasing your fees, making good money but if you're not being visible enough (find a mode, not a niche) then if a big client engagement ends you can enter a big deep dark hole where revenue tanks and you question everything. This can rock your confidence and send you into a tailspin. You have to build your fees and your visibility in lockstep. Dealflow dealflow dealflow.
- C'mon. You're STILL gonna want to craft a tight positioning. Don't do it. Just write. Streaks > niches. You'll think you have the confidence to actually nail a positioning statement now - something that's TRUE. But it's a trap. You'll end up getting stuck in this phase and never elevating out into phase 4 & 5.

## Phase 4: Find freedom

Here's where it starts to get fun. This is where that sparring idea comes in. You're approaching tenure and want to keep pushing to find client work that is BOTH well paid AND gives you time freedom.

Above the surface:

Below the surface:

Potential failure modes:
- A lot of the work is getting routine and easy here. You know how to generate clients. So what is there left? It's easy to get bored and disconnected from the work. Find a way to keep yourself interested in the work itself. Write a book about the practice of the work. Read some academic papers about your field. 
- Not building up a warchest. If you're building up cashflow and simply spending it then you're running a risk. By this time you've been self-employed for 5-7 years. The chances are only increasing that you're going to need to take time off for a medical emergency (you or loved ones). Or take an actual holiday. Or buy a house. So don't be stupid - cash looks like king but the world runs on credit/savings/retirement/health insurance etc. Start building wealth (mental, physical, economic).

## Phase 5: Build equity

I'm at the edges of the map now. I'm about to sail off the edge of the world according to my own map. I have only a hazy understanding of what phase 5 looks like or where it ends. Is there a phase 6? What are the failure modes for phase 5? I'm not compeltely sure because I'd consider myself somewhere right between phases 4 and 5. Here's some ideas:
