*Money* is having a bit of a moment right now.

Against the backdrop of Gamestop share trading via /r/wallstreetbets, and [people buying tweets as NFTs](https://twitter.com/whatdotcd/status/1341098300234211330), sometimes [for ~$2k](https://v.cent.co/tweet/923196967727124481) we've never seen more experimentation of media, markets and narratives.

In the middle of this - there's a little experiment, that might turn out to be a big idea. Jon Palmer is launching his next essay as an NFT crypto-asset, with a pre-sale for the essay token:

<p>I'm really excited to be trying something new this week: using crypto to crowdfund the next essay I'm writing, titled 'Scissor Labels.'</p>
<p>Instead of publishing my work for free, or putting it behind a paywall, I'm doing something in between: raising funds to produce a new essay in exchange for ownership of the work. This will allow me to devote my full time to writing the piece, while allowing it to exist as a public good for anyone to read.</p>
<p>Below is Mirror's new <a href="https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crowdfunding Block</a>, which contains everything you need to know about backing this project. The crowdfund will go live on <strong>Thursday, January 28th at 12pm PT</strong>.</p>

## Tokenized vs Paid Subscribers

The existing Substack model of paid subscribers is also having a moment. Twitter just bought Revue to compete, Forbes is launching some kind of paid newsletter product


## Crypto Models Without Crypto Gatekeepers


*Most importantly - this is a crypto-economics model that makes the essays free to read, where the 90% of your audience doesn't know how tokens work. But powered by the small crypto-native and crypto-curious that power the market*

## A New Kind of Bundling

Bundling (of newsletters) is the next big thing https://every.to/letter

But this crypto-economics model outlined here offers a radical new form of bundling. Creators can bundle not at the platform layer (i.e. publishing at the same place) but at the protocol layer (i.e. by selling their works on the same token).
